                             Anyone for IPS?

                          by James Miller G3RUH

The Phase IIID satellite under construction, like its predecessors P3A,
Oscar-10 and Oscar-13, has as its "brains", a computer system based on the
RCA COSMAC 1802 microprocessor.

The computer is running an operating system called "IPS", and loaded into
that environment is the flight software that does spacecraft command and
control, housekeeping chores, battery charge control, navigation, transponder
switching, beacon data generation and so on.
 
             But how many people know anything about IPS?

Not many nowadays, I'll bet.  Well, here's a unique opportunity to discover
all about it.

IPS (Interpreter for Process Structures) was devised by Karl Meinzer DJ4ZC
at a time when 1802, 6502, 6800 and 8080/Z80 processors were state of the
art; around 1976-1979.

At that time there just wasn't an easy-to-use, robust, engineering-
oriented, multitasking and, above all, *portable* operating system for
cheap computers based on these MPUs and their tiny (boldly described as
"massive") 16 Kbyte memories. Computers at that time meant the Atari 800,
North Star Horizon etc.

An IPS Manual was written by Karl Meinzer in 1978, but never published
in any substantive form.  A hand corrected draft printout was circulated to
a few interested AMSAT engineers who then reproduced it ad hoc, minus
several chunks, via ever worsening photocopies.  But the paper original was
long lost.

Happily, in 1996 the manual was discovered to have survived on Atari 800XL
computer cassette tapes, and moreover in the mid '80s had been transferred
to floppy disc by Robin Gape G8DQX, a prominent IPS contributor at that
time.

Thus, after a gap of nearly two decades, it has become practical to publish
the document properly, and that's what I have done.

IPS is a threaded language not unlike Forth, a brilliant piece of software
engineering, as relevant today as it ever was.

From Karl's introduction I quote:

  "This book is organized into three chapters of increasing sophistication.
  Chapter I presents an introduction to the language; the material
  presented there will enable you to accomplish all "regular" programming
  tasks. Chapter II introduces the assemblers for the COSMAC 1801/1802, the
  8080, the 6800 and the 6502 allowing low-level extensions and interfaces.
  Finally, Chapter III describes and documents the inner workings of IPS;
  this material will be useful if you wish to extend or change IPS itself."
